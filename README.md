The legacy HYPLAS code with multiscale modelling capabilities.

The code has been developed using Intel Fortran compiler. Therefore, it used some Intel-specific library, MKL.

I have modified the code so that it can be used with GNU Fortran compiler on personal computers. In the process, I have also fixed some bugs.
